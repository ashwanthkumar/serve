Serve is a tool that helps you serve Single Page Applications on your server.

## Features
1. Can serve SPA apps with 404 files defaulting to index.html for client side router to work properly.
2. Has ability to setup dynamic reverse proxies so we can route requests without CORS or any issues.
3. Reverse proxy returns the entire HTTP Headers and response as is.
4. We can proxy any HTTP method to the specified backend URL.
5. Supports redirection based on the `redirect_uri` query parameter. If a request contains this parameter, it will be redirected to the specified URI.
